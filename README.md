##During my CODTECH internship, I successfully completed all four Figma-based design tasks, which helped me enhance my UI/UX design skills and apply practical design concepts. For Task 1, I created three unique logo variations for a fictional brand, focusing on typography, color, and visual identity. In Task 2, I simulated a collaborative workflow in Figma by sharing a project, adding comments, and documenting version control through screenshots. Task 3 involved designing a fully interactive e-commerce product page that featured a 360° product view, detailed descriptions, and customer reviews. Lastly, in Task 4, I designed a smart home app interface with voice-controlled commands like “Turn off the lights” and “Set thermostat to 22°C,” including voice interaction flows to ensure a smooth user experience. These tasks were submitted via a structured GitHub repository and completed using Figma’s tools and collaborative features, while leveraging online resources and guidance provided by the internship team.
