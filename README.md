# Logo-Design-Mockup

"COMPONEY": CODETECH IT SOLUTIONS

"NAME": KALP PATEL

"INTERN ID": CT04DN12

"DOMAIN": FIGMA APP DEVELOPMENT

"MENTOR": NEELA SANTOSH

##In the first task, I designed a logo mockup by creating three unique variations for a fictional tech startup named "NovaTech." Each variation experimented with different typography, icon styles, and color palettes to reflect modern, minimalistic, and professional aesthetics. I used Figmaâ€™s vector tools and icon libraries to create scalable, clean designs. Additionally, I placed each logo on branded items like business cards and mobile app mockups to visualize their real-world applications. This task strengthened my understanding of brand identity, visual balance, and concept iteration.
